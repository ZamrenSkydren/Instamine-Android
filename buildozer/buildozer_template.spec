#    List as sections
#
#    You can define all the "list" as [section:key].
#    Each line will be considered as an option to the list.
#    Let's take [app] / source.exclude_patterns.
#    Instead of doing:
#
# [app]
# source.exclude_patterns = license,data/audio/*.wav,data/images/original/*
#
#    This can be translated into:
#
# [app:source.exclude_patterns]
# license
# data/audio/*.wav
# data/images/original/*
#
#
#    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    Profiles
#
#    You can extend section/key with a profile
#    For example, you want to deploy a demo version of your application without
#    HD content. You could first change the title to add "(demo)" in the name
#    and extend the excluded directories to remove the HD content.
#
# [app@demo]
# title = My Application (demo)
#
# [app:source.exclude_patterns@demo]
# images/hd/*
#
#    Then, invoke the command line with the "demo" profile:
#
# buildozer --profile demo android debug
